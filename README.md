# VulkanRenderer
This renderer was originally created in 2022â€“2023 as part of my studies. The aim of the project is not to provide a fully-fledged renderer for a game but to help me learn and understand the fundamentals of the Vulkan rendering API. To ensure I actually learned and understand what I was doing and did not simply mindlessly follow the amazing tutorial on by following [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/), I documented my learning process in several PDFs, which are available on my portfolio website or in the PDFs folder of this repository.

### 1. Rendering a Triangle
The first PDF documents my journey from creating a basic Vulkan instance to rendering my first triangle.
You can find the PDF [here](https://github.com/leymb/vRenderer/blob/main/PDFs/Rendering-a-triangle-using-Vulkan-MelvinRother.pdf)

### 2. Vertex Buffers
Since most of what I did to render a triangle in step one was setup, the actual data to render triangles etc. was mostly hard coded. The second PDF documents how I learned to use buffers for in-flight frame synchronization and to supply the GPU with vertex data. You can find the PDF [here](https://github.com/leymb/vRenderer/blob/main/PDFs/Vulkan-Vertex-Buffers-MelvinRother.pdf)

### 3. Texturing
The next step was learning how to texture the triangles. To texture triangles, I learned how to use Vulkan Image Objects and how to sample them. I also implemented Index and Uniform Buffers to avoid wasting memory when uploading data to the GPU and added proper object loading so that the renderer could now display nice objects.

### 4. Compute Shaders
I was interested in how to use compute shaders in Vulkan, so I learned how to use a separate Compute Pipeline (required since shading and compute pipelines are separate), SSBOs (Shader Storage Buffer Objects) and storage images (images that allow for read- and write operations).

Thank you to Alexander Overvoorde who created [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/). Without his tutorials, I would have not been able to learn this much about Vulkan before giving up completely.
